The Microsoft Graph JavaScript client library is a lightweight wrapper around the Microsoft Graph API that can be used server-side and in the browser.

## Installation

### Via npm

```cmd
npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client
```

import `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` into your module.

```typescript
import { Client } from "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client";
```

### Via Script Tag

Include `lib/graph-js-sdk-web.js` in your page.

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="graph-js-sdk-web.js"></script>
```

Incase if your application ships with [es6-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-promise) and [isomorphic-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isomorphic-fetch) just use `lib/graph-js-sdk-core.js`

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="graph-js-sdk-core.js"></script>
```

## Getting started

### 1. Register your application

Register your application to use Microsoft Graph API using one of the following supported authentication portals:

-   [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com): Register a new application that works with Microsoft Accounts and/or organizational accounts using the unified V2 Authentication Endpoint.
-   [Microsoft Azure Active Directory](https://manage.windowsazure.com): Register a new application in your tenant's Active Directory to support work or school users for your tenant or multiple tenants.

### 2. Authenticate for the Microsoft Graph service

The Microsoft Graph JavaScript Client Library has an adapter implementation ([MSALAuthenticationProvider](src/MSALAuthenticationProvider.ts)) for [MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-core) (Microsoft Authentication Library) which takes care of getting the `accessToken`. MSAL library does not ship with this library, user has to include it externally (For including MSAL, refer [this](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-core#installation)).

> **Note:** MSAL is supported only for frontend applications, for server-side authentication you have to implement your own AuthenticationProvider. Refer implementing [Custom Authentication Provider](./docs/CustomAuthenticationProvider.md).

#### Creating an instance of MSALAuthenticationProvider in browser environment

Refer devDependencies in [package.json](./package.json) for the compatible msal version and update that version in below.

```html
<script src="https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com/lib/<version>/js/msal.min.js"></script>
```

```typescript
const clientId = "your_client_id"; // Client Id of the registered application
const callback = (errorDesc, token, error, tokenType) => {};
// An Optional options for initializing the MSAL @see https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/MSAL-basics#configuration-options
const options = {
	redirectUri: "Your redirect URI",
};
const graphScopes = ["user.read", "mail.send"]; // An array of graph scopes

// Initialize the MSAL @see https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/MSAL-basics#initialization-of-msal
const userAgentApplication = new Msal.UserAgentApplication(clientId, undefined, callback, options);
const authProvider = new MicrosoftGraph.MSALAuthenticationProvider(userAgentApplication, graphScopes);
```

#### Creating an instance of MSALAuthenticationProvider in node environment

Refer devDependencies in [package.json](./package.json) for the compatible msal version and update that version in below.

```cmd
npm install msal@<version>
```

```typescript
import { UserAgentApplication } from "msal";

import { MSALAuthenticationProvider } from "./node_modules/@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client/lib/src/MSALAuthenticationProvider";

const clientId = "your_client_id"; // Client Id of the registered application
const callback = (errorDesc, token, error, tokenType) => {};
// An Optional options for initializing the MSAL @see https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/MSAL-basics#configuration-options
const options = {
	redirectUri: "Your redirect URI",
};
const graphScopes = ["user.read", "mail.send"]; // An array of graph scopes

// Initialize the MSAL @see https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/MSAL-basics#initialization-of-msal
const userAgentApplication = new UserAgentApplication(clientId, undefined, callback, options);
const authProvider = new MSALAuthenticationProvider(userAgentApplication, scopes);
```

User can integrate own preferred authentication library by implementing `IAuthenticationProvider` interface. Refer implementing [Custom Authentication Provider](./docs/CustomAuthenticationProvider.md).

### 3. Initialize a Microsoft Graph Client object with an authentication provider

An instance of the **Client** class handles requests to Microsoft Graph API and processing the responses. To create a new instance of this class, you need to provide an instance of [`IAuthenticationProvider`](src/IAuthenticationProvider.ts) which needs to be passed as a value for `authProvider` key in [`ClientOptions`](src/IClientOptions.ts) to a static initializer method `Client.initWithMiddleware`.

#### For browser environment

```typescript
const options = {
	authProvider, // An instance created from previous step
};
const Client = MicrosoftGraph.Client;
const client = Client.initWithMiddleware(options);
```

#### For node environment

```typescript
import { Client } from "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client";

const options = {
	authProvider, // An instance created from previous step
};
const client = Client.initWithMiddleware(options);
```

For more information on initializing client, refer [this document](./docs/CreatingClientInstance.md).

### 4. Make requests to the graph

Once you have authentication setup and an instance of Client, you can begin to make calls to the service. All requests should be start with `client.api(path)` and end with an [action](./docs/Actions.md).

Getting user details

```typescript
try {
	let userDetails = await client.api("/me").get();
	console.log(userDetails);
} catch (error) {
	throw error;
}
```

Sending an email to the recipients

```typescript
// Construct email object
const mail = {
	subject: "Microsoft Graph JavaScript Sample",
	toRecipients: [
		{
			emailAddress: {
				address: "example@example.com",
			},
		},
	],
	body: {
		content: "<h1>MicrosoftGraph JavaScript Sample</h1>Check out https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript",
		contentType: "html",
	},
};
try {
	let response = await client.api("/me/sendMail").post({ message: mail });
	console.log(response);
} catch (error) {
	throw error;
}
```
